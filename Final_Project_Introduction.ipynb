When people are moving from one place to the other. Sometimes they may want to move to a similar neighborhood to the one they are currently living in. By similar I mean maybe for both neighbors there are shopping malls nearby, similar kind of resturants. Currently I live in Nashville, TN, USA. Supposed that I find a new job in New York City and want to find a similar neighbor to which I am currently living. How can I do this?\n\n\n### This project will also help a lot of other people with similar concerns, so this study will be very helpful."
